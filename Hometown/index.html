        <div class="abount-content">
            <p>Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s busy capital, sits at the junction of the Mekong and Tonlé Sap rivers. It was a hub for both the Khmer Empire and French colonialists. On its walkable riverfront, lined with parks, restaurants and bars, are the ornate Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and the National Museum, displaying artifacts from around the country. At the city’s heart is the massive, art deco Central Market.</p>

                    <p>Travelers must try this authentic Khmer street food at least somewhere in Cambodia. The renowned snack is prepared by cooking fish moose with coconut curry in banana leaves. In order to build layers of flavor, a wide selection of spices such as lemongrass, kaffir lime and turmeric root are added. Although fish amok can also be found in neighboring countries, one unique feature of Cambodian fish amok is the use of the local herb slok ngor, which adds a distinct and bitter flavor to the dish.</p>

                    <p>This classic Southeast Asian treat has its roots in Vietnam. However, once lok lak landed in Cambodia, it became overwhelmingly popular. One possible reason is the juicy beef – a favourite local meat – that comes in colossal portions. This stir fried meat is typically topped with a salad of sweet tomato, crispy lettuce, raw cucumber and fresh onion, all served seasoned with lime juice and black pepper. Travellers can opt for the traditional way of eating – wrapped up in a lettuce leaf in the way of classic Cambodian culture.</p>

                    <p>Popular with the young Khmer crowd, the Night Market, or Phsar Reatrey, is an open-air evening affair located on riverside. A collection of stalls sell clothes, accessories and food, with a central stage hosting live performances in the form of singers, musicians and dancers. It can get lively at weekends and while the stalls don’t sell anything of particular interest, it makes a good spot to stop off before dinner and drinks on riverside.</p>
